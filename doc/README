LINEDIT

 Linedit is a readline-style library written in Common Lisp that
 provides customizable line-editing for Common Lisp programs.

 Version 0.11 uses UFFI for foreign bindings, and is hence
 theoretically portable. The development and testing has so far been
 carried out on SBCL, however. Patches are welcome.

 The current input handling is only empirically correct -- which is a
 gentile way of saying "works on my box, dunno about yours". Once
 again: patches are welcome.

 For more information, and the latest version of Linedit visit

 USAGE
 -----

 > (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :uffi)

 > (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :linedit)

 > (linedit:linedit :prompt "-> ")

 > (linedit:formedit :prompt1 "=> " :prompt2 "|   ")


 USING FORMEDIT IN SBCL REPL
 ---------------------------

  Call (LINEDIT:INSTALL-REPL :WRAP-CURRENT T) in your .sbclrc. If you
  don't want to preserve your current input handler you can omit the
  WRAP-CURRENT keyword.

  This should be simple to port to other systems that provide similar
  hooks.


 INTERFACE
 ---------

  The exported interface used to be documented here, but was cleared
  out for a while -- until things stabilize a bit more. 1.0 at latest
  will se it back.

  For the duration you should read the sources.
