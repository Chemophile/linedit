Linedit TODO

* Switch to Git.
* Use CFFI instead of UFFI.
* Use terminfo properly instead of ad-hoc terminal translations.
* See how much of the C-side glue is really necessary.
* Some of the terminal stuff is very similar to bits of TTY hemlock
*** Maybe refactor into a library both can use?
*** There may be other parts Linedit and Hemlock could share...
